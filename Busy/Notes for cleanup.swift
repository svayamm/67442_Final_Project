/*
 
 Notes for cleanup:
 
 split view controller code into viewModel + viewController

 review forced downcasts in VC files - should these be done 'safely'???
 
 project name duplicates edge case (titleAsKey dictionary does not allow for duplicate project titles)
 
 check authentication state?, call functions for filtering table and actions if authenticated
